# jeff.codes Gatsby + Netlify CMS

This is the temporary landing page for jeff.codes. Based off of the [Gatsby + Netlify Starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
